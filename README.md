# SQL-Assignment

How should I approach the assignment solution?

 

Step 1: Creating the schema

In this step, you will create the schema for this assignment. Please follow the instructions given below in the same order:

Create a database/schema and name it as "superstoresdb"
Download the SQLAssignment(Instruction File) file available on next page. Follow the instructions given in Task 0 to create all the tables.
Step 2: Importing the data to the tables

MySQL allows us to import the data from csv, json files into the tables. You are required to do the same in MySQL Workbench through the following steps.

Using the "Navigator" pane at the left-hand side, locate your database i.e. "superstoresdb"
Expand it to get the tables list
 Right-click on the table name to get the menu.
Select "Table Data Import Wizard" from this menu.
Follow the steps of the wizard and the data will be imported in respective tables
Repeat this process for all the tables in the schema.
